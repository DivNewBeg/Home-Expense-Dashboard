The objective of the 'Home Expense Dashboard' project is to: -
1) Monitor historical trends for home expenses.
2) Generate insights based on historical expense data.

Insights generated from the above report can then be used to take actions that minimize home
expenditure in future months.

This is a Power BI project. The project is presently ongoing.
A demo of the project is available in the 'Home Expense Demo.mp4' video.
